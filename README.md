# Python List Comprehension
As we know that there exist a Pythonic technique of constructing a list from an existing list called list comprehension. It is fast and efficient than for loops. It is more readable and at the same time it simplifies our code. It has the ability to represent the multiple statements containing for loop, if-else statement as well as appending modified content all in a single beautiful line of code into a new list. But that's not all! We can also use them to customize strings and apply a different set of rules on different characters. This is the true power of list comprehension.

In this repo, I tried to explore all the benefits of list comprehension in the realm of for loops, conditional statements, string manipulation as well as higher-order function.

Every list comprehension should follow the template as following:
<h4><code>my_list=[ expression for item in iterable (if condition) ]</code></h4>
Itâ€™s very clean and straightforward. Just uses two square brackets including three key components:
<br>
<ul>
<li>A for-loop to iterate an iterable</li>
<li>An expression to deal with the item</li>
<li>An optional if condition</li>
</ul>
